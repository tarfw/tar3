# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to create, configure, and interact with custom AI agents within the application. Users will be able to build personalized AI assistants that can access their data from Instant DB and Turso DB, perform tasks, and provide intelligent responses using the Vercel AI SDK. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for agent creation, configuration management, and real-time interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create custom AI agents with specific personalities and capabilities, so that I can have personalized AI assistants tailored to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the agent creation screen THEN the system SHALL display a form with fields for agent name, description, personality traits, and capabilities
2. WHEN a user submits a valid agent configuration THEN the system SHALL create a new agent record in the database with a unique identifier
3. WHEN a user creates an agent THEN the system SHALL validate that the agent name is unique within their account
4. IF the agent name already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent creation
5. WHEN an agent is successfully created THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the agent management screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my AI agents with specific data access permissions and capabilities, so that each agent can perform relevant tasks with appropriate data access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures an agent THEN the system SHALL provide options to grant access to specific data sources (notes, issues, user data)
2. WHEN a user selects data permissions THEN the system SHALL store these permissions securely in the agent configuration
3. WHEN an agent is configured with capabilities THEN the system SHALL validate that the user has permission to grant those capabilities
4. IF a user tries to grant unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL prevent the configuration and display an appropriate error
5. WHEN agent permissions are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new permissions to future interactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with my custom AI agents through a chat interface, so that I can get personalized assistance and responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an agent to chat with THEN the system SHALL open a dedicated chat interface for that agent
2. WHEN a user sends a message to an agent THEN the system SHALL process the message using the Vercel AI SDK with the agent's configuration
3. WHEN an agent processes a message THEN the system SHALL apply the agent's personality and access permissions to generate appropriate responses
4. WHEN an agent needs to access user data THEN the system SHALL only access data sources that the agent has been granted permission to use
5. WHEN a chat session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and history for that specific agent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my collection of AI agents, so that I can organize, edit, and delete agents as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the agent management screen THEN the system SHALL display a list of all their created agents with basic information
2. WHEN a user selects an agent from the list THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit, delete, or chat with the agent
3. WHEN a user edits an agent THEN the system SHALL allow modification of name, description, personality, and permissions
4. WHEN a user deletes an agent THEN the system SHALL remove the agent and all associated chat history after confirmation
5. WHEN agents are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the last interaction date and agent status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my AI agents to have access to my notes and issues data, so that they can provide contextual assistance based on my existing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is granted access to notes THEN the system SHALL allow the agent to search and reference user notes in responses
2. WHEN an agent is granted access to issues THEN the system SHALL allow the agent to view and reference user issues in responses
3. WHEN an agent accesses user data THEN the system SHALL ensure data is retrieved from both Instant DB and Turso DB as appropriate
4. WHEN an agent references user data THEN the system SHALL include relevant context while maintaining data privacy
5. IF an agent lacks permission for requested data THEN the system SHALL inform the user about the limitation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my AI agent interactions to be saved and synchronized across devices, so that I can continue conversations seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to an agent THEN the system SHALL save the message and response to the hybrid database
2. WHEN a user switches devices THEN the system SHALL synchronize agent configurations and chat history
3. WHEN chat history is loaded THEN the system SHALL display messages in chronological order with proper attribution
4. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL queue messages and sync when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using timestamp-based conflict resolution

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my AI agents with different models and response styles, so that I can optimize each agent for specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring an agent THEN the system SHALL provide options to select from available AI models
2. WHEN a user selects a model THEN the system SHALL validate model availability and user permissions
3. WHEN an agent uses a specific model THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate rate limiting and usage tracking
4. WHEN response style is configured THEN the system SHALL include style parameters in the AI model requests
5. IF a selected model becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to a default model and notify the user

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want my complete AI agent flows and configurations to be stored in Instant DB, so that my agents can be fully reconstructed and executed with real-time synchronization across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is created THEN the system SHALL store the complete agent definition including personality, instructions, and behavioral rules in Instant DB
2. WHEN a user builds an agent flow THEN the system SHALL store the entire flow logic as structured data including all steps, conditions, and decision trees in Instant DB
3. WHEN an agent flow contains custom prompts THEN the system SHALL store all prompt templates and variables as part of the agent configuration in Instant DB
4. WHEN an agent has data access rules THEN the system SHALL store all permission mappings and data source configurations in Instant DB
5. WHEN an agent is executed THEN the system SHALL reconstruct the complete agent behavior from the stored Instant DB configuration
6. WHEN agent flows include conditional logic THEN the system SHALL store all if-then rules, triggers, and response patterns in Instant DB for real-time access
7. WHEN users create complex multi-step flows THEN the system SHALL store the complete workflow sequence with branching logic in Instant DB
8. WHEN agents need to log interactions or store analytics data THEN the system SHALL use Turso DB for row-based record storage
9. WHEN an agent is loaded THEN the system SHALL retrieve and instantiate the complete agent from Instant DB with real-time synchronization
