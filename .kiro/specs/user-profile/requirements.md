# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user profile system for the React Native/Expo application. The profile feature will allow users to view and manage their personal information, preferences, and account settings within the existing tab-based navigation structure. The profile will integrate with the current authentication system and hybrid database setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses security settings THEN the system SHALL display options to change password and manage sessions
2. WHEN a user initiates a password change THEN the system SHALL require current password verification
3. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL update the authentication credentials securely
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all local session data and redirect to the authentication screen

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my activity and usage statistics, so that I can understand my engagement with the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display relevant statistics such as issues created, items managed, and recent activity
